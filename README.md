# My CSS Grid
This is an example of rolling your own CSS grid system.
It is based on a 6 column grid in a container that is 100%
Currently this grid system or framework has the grid, some basic typography and showing nesting of columns.

This is a work in progress and will eventually have other UI elements in it.

This grid is a 6 column grid, this can be changed according to own requirements.
